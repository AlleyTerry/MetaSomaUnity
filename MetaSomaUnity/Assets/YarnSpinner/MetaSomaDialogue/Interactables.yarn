Grub: …leave… leave me be…
Imeris: !
Imeris: You’re still alive? Oh Goddess…
Imeris: What happened here?
Grub: Why are you asking that…? You should know… We’ve been abandoned.
Imeris: Abandoned?
Grub: Her Majesty vanished, and there was no one to take her place. They all left… 
Imeris: They…? The bees? They left us all here?!
Grub: Perhaps not all. A select few seem to have vanished alongside them… but we’re all disappearing now. 
Grub: I myself will vanish too, soon.
Grub: I’m just so hungry… but there’s nothing I can do now.
Grub: He’s taken it all… every last scrap… there’s nothing left for me. I don’t have the energy to try and take anything back.
Imeris: He… Father Linnaeus?
Grub: He’s locked his door again, hasn’t he? You may yet have the will to go on…
Grub: The key to the chapel… I’ve hidden it underneath the bust of Her Majesty. Linnaeus would never dream of moving her from her spot, the sycophantic fool…
Grub: Go. Take it. Sneak in and steal back the food he has stolen, so you may live just a bit longer.
Grub: Though there is little left to live for anymore…
Imeris: …Thank you.
Grub: Yes, yes. Now please… just leave me be. I’d like to rest.
Imeris: …
